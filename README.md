# csv-to-vcf
 Simple script to convert csv files to vCard files formatted for iOS.
 Although it is *claimed* that iCloud allows one to upload CSV files, I have had
 absolutely no luck doing this, and after much frustration decided to auto-gen
 my own VCF from CSV.

 Discovering what iCloud requires keys to be named is an obtuse process; I used GPT.
